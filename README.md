# NBA Statistics Dataset Project

Howdy! This will be an ongoing project that I will use to showcase data-related skills I learn during my statistics and computer science classes. I will attempt to explain basketball-specific terms, but there are many technical terms and abbreviations that I will not elaborate on in an effort to keep the code clean. I encourage anyone curious about the ins and outs of any topics to look them up, basketball is a fascinating sport!

# Topics Covered (so far):

1. Who faced more competition: LeBron or Jordan?
