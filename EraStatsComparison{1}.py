# NBA Statistics Dataset Project: Who faced more competition, LeBron or Jordan?

# The basketball GOAT debate takes many perspectives. You may hear people say Kobe
# Bryant, Wilt Chamberlain, Bill Russell, or Kareem Abdul-Jabbar is their GOAT. Some
# people highly value championships, skill, awards, impact on the era, or talent. Yet,
# the clear-cut favorite for most people is either LeBron James or Michael Jordan.
# I do not plan to settle this debate here (though I do favor LeGreatness!), but I 
# will try to show who played in the more difficult era: LeBron's Era or
# Jordan's Era (will not consider Wizard's playing time since those teams
# were not expected to grow nor compete for a title). I will analyze the years
# starting in which either player began competing in the playoffs for their 
# respective careers

# # Hmmmm......

# # Conclusion 1: Players who are at least role-players from each era average
# similar 'per game' numbers, with a slight edge to LeBron's era.

# Conclusion 2: According to the advanced statistics, players who are at least
# good role-players from LeBron's era are more efficient than those of Jordan's
# era.

# Conclusion 3: When considering mean 'per game' and advanced statistics from 
# both eras, LeBron has faced more players who are at least good role players!

# # Potential flaws or improvements?

# Flaw 1: During the years of both stars, there were moments of expansion for 
# the NBA. For example, the NBA had 23 teams during Jordan's rookie season. Now,
# it has 30! 
#   How to Address: To adjust for this, we can turn the Players Per Year (PPY) stat in
#   the table into a Players Per Team (PPT) stat. After all, the PPY stat was added to
#   address the fact that LeBron has/will play for much longer than Jordan! To do this
#   we would need to divide the PPY stat by the corresponding number of teams for the year

# Flaw 2: With so many skilled talented players from all over the globe who
# have been trained since they were in primary school, couldn't there be outliers
# or statistical phenoms in today's era (in which LeBron played/plays in)? Players 
# such as Luka Doncic, who has averaged nearly a triple-double for many seasons, or
# James Harden, who has had historical scoring seasons. Couldn't they skew the mean?
#   How to Address: Why absolutely! There can be outliers in any large dataset, and
#   for this predicament we can look at the median statistics rather than the mean
#   statistics and compare those between the eras.
