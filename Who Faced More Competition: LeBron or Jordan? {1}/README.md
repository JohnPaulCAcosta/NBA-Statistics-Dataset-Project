# Who Faced More Competition: LeBron or Jordan?

Howdy! This project utilizes the following libraries:
1. Pandas
2. Matplotlib

To determine which player faced more competition, I have created tables containing the mean of standard and advanced per-game statistics for the players of LeBron and Jordan's eras. The players considered to create the mean values in the tables have statistics that either meet or surpass standards defined in the .py file, which I encourage anyone to download and play around with themselves See if your numbers suggest a conclusion other than what I concluded in the comments at the end of the file!

For more detailed notes on the step-by-step processes, please see the ErasStatsComparison.py file and the # comments within the file.
